#  Frontend Assignment – Card UI with React

This is a simple and responsive React application that displays a list of product items as cards. Users can **add** new cards and **delete** existing ones. Data is fetched and persisted using **MockAPI**. The application is styled for a clean, professional look and is deployed on GitHub Pages.
